MATLAB Script Repository
========================

This repository contains my MATLAB scripts, that I've written. All the scripts
support (and were tested on) both Mathworks MATLAB and GNU Octave.

For the scripts using HHM files, some examples are available in the 'hhm'
directory to test with.

The following scripts are stored in this repository.
- hhmbinread.m: Reads a HHM binary file into a structure.
- processecg.m: Process and plot an ECG signal read from a HHM binary file.
