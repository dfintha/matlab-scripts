MATLAB Script Repository
========================

This repository contains my MATLAB scripts, that I've written. All the scripts
support (and were tested on) both Mathworks MATLAB and GNU Octave.

For the sources using HHM files, some examples are available in the 'hhm'
directory to test with.

The following functions are stored in this repository.
- hhmbinread.m: Function to read a HHM binary file into a structure.
- findminmax.m: Function to find local minimum and maximum in a range.

The following scripts are stored in this repository.
- processecg.m: Process and plot an ECG signal read from a HHM binary file.
- bloodpressure.m: Process a PPG signal and find the systolic blood pressure
                   based on the cuff pressure and the amplitude of the PPG wave.
